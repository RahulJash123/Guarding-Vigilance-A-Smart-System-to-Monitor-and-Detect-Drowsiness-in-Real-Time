# Guarding Vigilance: A Smart System to Detect and Defeat Drowsiness in Real-Time

This project is a desktop application that detects driver drowsiness in real-time using a webcam. It uses facial landmarks to monitor eye closure, yawning, and head tilt, then gives alerts if signs of fatigue are detected.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Detects prolonged eye closure (blinks)
- Detects yawning and head tilting
- Real-time video analysis using webcam
- Voice alerts using text-to-speech (pyttsx3)
- Custom GUI built using CustomTkinter
- Statistics panel for recent alerts
- Gemini AI integration to summarize alert data

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python (OpenCV, MediaPipe, pyttsx3, Pandas, CustomTkinter)
- Electron.js (Node.js + Chromium GUI)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Google Gemini API (for statistical analysis)
